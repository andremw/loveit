A Node/WebSockets app for the auto instructional classes 

###How to run the app
In order to run the app you'll need [**Node.js**](http://nodejs.org/) installed.
After installing Node.js, go to the folder in the terminal and type *npm install*. This will install all the dependencies (libraries) required to run the app.

Then just type node app.js and be happy. :)
